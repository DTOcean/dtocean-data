<H2>General Description</H2>
<P> The device used in this example is a flap only allowed to pitch around a point located 8.9 m below
<P> The mean water level.

<H2>Geometry</H2>
<P> The flap dimensions are 1.8x18x10.9 m.
<P> The mesh of the submerged part of the barge is shown in the figure below.

<P> The mesh is composed of 551 panels.


<H2> Body description </H2>
<P> The rotation point at 8.9 m below the mean water level is the point of application to the equation of motion.

<H2> Mass </H2>
<P> The inertia tensor is assumed:
<P> [1850000., 0.0, 0.0;
<P>  0.0, 1850000., 0.0;
<P>  0.0, 0.0, 1850000.]

<H2> PTO </H2>
<P> The PTO damping is assumed to be 4000000 N m s/rad.

<H2> Mooring </H2>
<P> No mooring stiffness is taken into account.
