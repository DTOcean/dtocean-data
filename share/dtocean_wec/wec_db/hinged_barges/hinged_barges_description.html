<H1>Two Barges Attenuator</H1>
<H2>General Description</H2>
<P> The device used in this example consists of two barges and is allowed to move in surge, heave and pitch. 
<P> Besides, a generalized degree of freedom, a pitching around the joint connection between the two barges,
<P> is taken into account. Overall, the device motion is modelled through these 3+1 independent modes of motion.

<H2>Geometry</H2>
<P> Both barges have the exact same geometry 7.85x10x10 m.
<P> The meshes of the submerged part of both barges are shown in the figure below.

<P> The mesh for each barge is composed of 250 panels.


<H2> Body description </H2>
<P> The connection point between the two barges is taken as the (0, 0, 0) of the global reference system.
<P> The barge situated at the negative-x-side is modelled as the parent of the positive-x-side barge, and 
<P> this as the child of the negative-x-side barge. The relative degree of freedom between the child and
<P> its parent is a rotation around the y-axis. 

<H2> Mass </H2>
<P> The mass of each barge is 785000 kg, while the inertia tensor is assumed:
<P> [10572805.2083, 0.0, 0.0;
<P>  0.0, 10572805.2083, 0.0;
<P>  0.0, 0.0, 10572805.2083] kg m^2.

<H2> PTO </H2>
<P> The PTO is associated to the generalized pitch mode and the damping coefficient is assumed to be 1200000 N m s/rad.

<H2> Mooring </H2>
<P> The mooring is associated to the surge mode and the stiffness coefficient is assumed to be 1402000 N/m.
